# s3-presigned-urls-examples

Code examples on how to generate and use S3 pre-signed URLs using the JavaScript SDK v3.

These examples are being used in the following resources (which are highly recommended to fully appreciate the topic):

- My article on S3 pre-signed URLs: [The illustrated guide to S3 pre-signed URLs](https://fourtheorem.com/the-illustrated-guide-to-s3-pre-signed-urls/)
- My talk at the AWS Dublin User Group: [Everything I know about S3 pre-signed URLs](https://fth.link/presign)
